# Bus-reservation-system-using-BST
This program is a simple implementation of a Bus Reservation System using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It allows users to view available buses, book tickets, cancel bookings, view bus seat status, and check reservation information.

Features:-
User Authentication: Users are required to log in with a username and password before accessing reservation functionalities.
Booking Management: Users can book tickets for buses by selecting the desired bus and number of seats.
Cancellation: The program allows users to cancel their reservations by providing the reservation number.
Seat Status: Users can check the availability of seats in each bus.
Reservation Information: Users can view details of their reservations by entering the reservation number and customer ID.

Note:-
1.Binary Search Tree (BST): Reservations are managed using a BST, where each node represents a reservation. The BST facilitates efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
2.Seat Representation: Seats in each bus are represented by a 2D array, where 0 indicates an empty seat and 1 indicates a booked seat.
